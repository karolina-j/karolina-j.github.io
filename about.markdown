This portal is created for the final project from the course 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization.

Our article investigates what drives Olympic success by comparing 20 countries across three key dimensions: population size, economic strength (GDP), and human development (AHDI). Using historical medal data, we reveal how each factor contributes to national performance â€” and where it falls short. From global powerhouses to surprising outliers, the story uncovers the mix of scale, resources, and social systems behind the medal count.
